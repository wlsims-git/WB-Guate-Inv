Analysis of the allocation of World Bank investment in Guatemala

This repository provides documentation of the Stata analysis for my paper _Is World Bank Investment in Guatemala Responsive to Departmental Needs?_ 

The paper adapts the "Bayesian Surprise Map" framework developed by Michael Correll and Jeffrey Heer of the UW Interactive Data Lab (available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@uwdata/surprise-maps-showing-the-unexpected-e92b67398865) and as a [2017 conference paper](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2017-SurpriseMaps-InfoVis.pdf)). In essence, the framework looks at "surprising" variation, once other information about geographic areas is taken into account. 

In this case, I look at the level of World Bank investment across geographic departments in Guatemala, once factors such as population and poverty rates are taken into account. This can help us identify departments that are over- or under-invested relative to their "need."

This repository contains the following:
1. A PDF version of the paper
2. A folder containing Stata code (one for data cleaning and one for analysis), data, and shape files for mapping
